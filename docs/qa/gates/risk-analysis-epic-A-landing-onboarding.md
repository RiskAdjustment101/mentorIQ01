## 1. Functional Risks
- [ ] Authentication errors (Clerk misconfig, SSO failure).  
- [ ] Invite codes invalid/expired.  
- [ ] Session creation edge cases (duplicate, bad inputs).  

## 2. Non-Functional Risks
- [ ] Performance degradation (LCP > 2.5s, slow APIs).  
- [ ] Accessibility failures (low contrast, missing labels).  
- [ ] Reliability under load (error rate >0.5%).  

## 3. Compliance & Security Risks
- [ ] Unauthorized access (RBAC bypass).  
- [ ] Consent not enforced before child-linked actions.  
- [ ] Audit events missing for mutating calls.  

## 4. Mitigation Plan
- Automated tests (unit + e2e).  
- Manual QA for accessibility.  
- Observability dashboards (performance + error rates).  
- Feature flags for risky features.

## Result
- PASS = Risks documented + mitigations in place  
- CONCERNS = Minor risks remain, tracked as tickets  
- FAIL = Unmitigated critical risks
