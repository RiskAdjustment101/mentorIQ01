## Objectives
1. **Risk Review**
   - Fill `sec-001-risk-YYYYMMDD.md` with identified functional and compliance risks.
   - Focus on RLS, RBAC, consent, audit immutability, and JWT/webhook validation.

2. **Test Design**
   - Update `sec-001-test-design-YYYYMMDD.md`.
   - Confirm test coverage for RLS, RBAC, consent enforcement, audit immutability, JWT/webhooks.
   - Specify tools: psql, Prisma, Playwright, CI.

3. **Traceability**
   - Update `sec-001-trace-YYYYMMDD.md` mapping requirements ↔ test cases.
   - Ensure all acceptance criteria from the story are covered.

4. **NFR Validation**
   - Update `sec-001-nfr-YYYYMMDD.md`.
   - Assess performance overhead, observability, alerting, and audit immutability.
   - Verify reliability (RLS policy enforcement, CI isolation suite duration).

   - Summarize all results in `review-sec-001-phase1-iam-hardening.md`.
   - For each gate: mark PASS / CONCERNS / FAIL.
   - Provide an overall verdict (PASS = merge; CONCERNS = fix before merge; FAIL = block merge).
