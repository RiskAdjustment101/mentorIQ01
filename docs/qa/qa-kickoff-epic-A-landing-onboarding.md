## Objectives
1. **Risk Review**
   - Load and extend `risk-analysis-epic-A-landing-onboarding.md`
   - Ensure coverage of auth, Clerk integration, no-scroll constraint, accessibility, and analytics logging.

2. **Design Review**
   - Validate against `design-review-epic-A-landing-onboarding.md` and `ui-theme.md`.
   - Confirm shadcn/ui usage, dark theme, Inter font, orange accent, and single CTA.

3. **Test Design**
   - Check `test-design-epic-A-landing-onboarding.md` for completeness.
   - Verify coverage of functional, accessibility, performance, and security test cases.

4. **Traceability**
   - Fill `traceability-epic-A-landing-onboarding.md` mapping requirements ↔ test cases.
   - Ensure 100% acceptance criteria from the story are mapped.

5. **NFR Validation**
   - Confirm alignment with `nfr-checklist.md` (performance, reliability, accessibility, security).

6. **Security/Compliance**
   - Validate against `security-epic-A-landing-onboarding.md` (Clerk session, RBAC, audit events).

7. **Final Gate Review**
   - Summarize results in `review-epic-A-landing-onboarding.md` with PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL for each gate and overall.
   - Highlight any blockers before merge.
