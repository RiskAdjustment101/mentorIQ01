# Landing Copy — Split-Screen (Epic A0)

## Hero (Left Pane)
**Headline:** AI-Powered Mentorship for FLL Teams
**Subtext:** Plan smarter, save time, and inspire students with your AI co-pilot.
**Primary CTA:** Get Started  *(opens Clerk SSO: Google/Microsoft/email)*
**Secondary text (optional, tiny):** Already have an account? Sign in

## Differentiators (Right Pane)

## Notes
- Single screen, **no vertical scroll** at 1366×768.
- Keep right-pane copy concise; 1–2 lines per point.
- Use shadcn/ui icons or simple glyphs; avoid stock images.
